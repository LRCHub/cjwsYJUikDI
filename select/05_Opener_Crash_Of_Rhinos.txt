You're as cold as the drink in your hand now.
It's as clear as the lines on your brow
Its as dull as the tone of your voice
And as dark as the oak in your eyes
Every breath you take puts the past in it right place
Every word you say
An enthusiast's guide in not wasting time
You're right
Bad appetites, in real life
Wont help us sleep at night
You're right
Bad appetites, in real life
Wont help us sleep at night
You're right
We'll continue together
As secrets are clenched in our palms
And that spring lives forever
In scars that never leave sight
Every breath you take puts the past in its right place
Every word you say
An enthusiast's guide to not wasting time
You're right
Bad appetites, in real life
Wont help us sleep at night
You're right
Bad appetites, in real life
Wont help us sleep at night
We're mixed together
We're mixed together
We're mixed together
We're mixed together
