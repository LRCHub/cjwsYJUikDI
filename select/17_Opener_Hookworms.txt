It's fine to fail, we all will fail
I want you to know I don't judge you if you're still feelin' frail
I'm scared to break, I know you wouldn't tell me
We both know it's unhealthy, still not open anyway

But we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't
Oh, we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't

Oh, this feeling hardly picks up our smothered, slow existence
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't last the distance
It's hard to find a better word or you can candy-coat your shortcomings
And press them till they're hidden from the world or just let it roll out

Don't fall under, just let it roll out
Don't fall under, please let it roll out
Don't fall under

The city girl, daddy would try
We can help each other
The city girl, maybe she's right
You make me see in color
We can help each other
And we can see in color
And I'm always looking for a way to reach out
While I'm dreamin' of a way out
Always looking for a sense to knock down
Feeling is fresh more yeah

Yeah, we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't
Oh, we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't

Oh, we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't
Oh, we can't foresee
What we can't have lost
What we can't have lost
What we can't

What we can't
What we can't
Save what we can
Oh, we can't
Oh, we can't
Oh, we can't
Save what we can
What we can
