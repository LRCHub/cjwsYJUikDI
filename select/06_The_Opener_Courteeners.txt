I've been away I've been working
But now I'm back I need to know if you're still there
And I need to know if you still care

Of course you do
Of course you do
You were made for me
And I was made for you

Somethings change but the majority
Stands still and I need to know if you want to
And I need to know if you will

Of course you do
Of course you do
But I was made for this place
And I was made for you

I don't know if you would welcome me
Back with open arms through the door
I don't expect anything but please know
That I love you for sure (please be sure)

I miss your eyelashes and the street where I grew tall
I miss getting pissed wet threw getting to yours and getting warm

I miss stopping over and borrowing someone else's clothes
So nice to be home you'd never have known that I've even been away

I miss the city I love but I've been having an affair
With LA and New York, Dundee and Doncaster if I may dare

Of course I do
Of course I do
But I was meant for this place
And I was meant for you

I miss the city I love but I've been having an
Affair with LA and New York, Dundee and Doncaster.
If you should care
Of course you do
Of course you do
But I was made for this place
And I was made for you

My heart is here and here to stay
