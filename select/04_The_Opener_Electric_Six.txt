Do it while we're young
[?] like a pinion

Do I see nothing like it in your life
It's gonna cut you like a knife

Be careful when you come to see us rock
You're gonna die from the shock

Gonna die from the shock, yeah
The shock, yeah

Make some noise, minion
Make some noise, make some noise

I see nothing like it in your life
It's gonna cut you like a knife
Sell off all the shares of your stock
Be careful when you come to see us rock
You're gonna die from the shock

Gonna die from the shock, yeah
The shock, yeah

Do I see nothing like it in your life
It's gonna cut you like a knife
Sell off all the shares of your stock
Be careful when you come to see us rock
