She sits alone in a crowded room
She says someday will get here soon
And when it does
Boy, I'm oughta here

She says I don't remember love
But it must be cut above
From what's going on around here

What is wrong with me?
I'm out of love
These are the dreams that scars are made of
Is it too much to ask to win just once?
Just once?
She says
X marks the spot
Where I used to feel
Baby it's all right cuz it
Never heals

What is wrong with me?
I'm out of love
These are the dreams that scars are made of
Is it too much to ask to win just once?
Just once?

Isn't wanting enough?
Isn't wanting enough?

What is wrong with me?
I'm out of love
These are the dreams that scars are made of
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
